# JSONFeed
This is the repository for the [JSONFeed.org](https://jsonfeed.org/) website. It contains the Markdown files and supporting resources, not the actual rendered website.

The current spec, and any older specs (if we ever do more than one), are in the [pages/version/](https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/blob/master/pages/version/) folder.
